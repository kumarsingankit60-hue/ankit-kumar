# The Funky King — E-Commerce Website

A premium Gen-Z fashion e-commerce website with an anti-gravity landing effect inspired by Google Anti-Gravity. The site features a green/blue/silver gradient theme, glassmorphism UI, bold typography, and smooth animations.

## Proposed Changes

### File Structure

#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/ankit/Desktop/ai/index.html)
Complete HTML structure with all sections:
- **Anti-gravity landing page** — minimal centered layout (brand name + tagline + "Enter Shop" button)
- **Main site** (hidden initially, revealed after gravity animation):
  - Sticky navigation bar (Home, Shop, Men, Women, New Arrivals, Contact, Cart with counter badge)
  - Hero section with bold "The Funky King" branding and CTA
  - Featured Products grid (6 product cards with image, name, price, "Add to Cart" button)
  - Categories section (Men, Women, Accessories, New Arrivals cards)
  - About Brand section with marketing copy
  - Footer with social media icons and links
- Reset button to replay the anti-gravity animation

#### [NEW] [styles.css](file:///c:/Users/ankit/Desktop/ai/styles.css)
All styling using modern CSS:
- **Design system** — CSS custom properties for the green/blue/silver palette, typography scale, spacing
- **Animated gradient background** — shifting green-blue-silver gradient via `@keyframes`
- **Glassmorphism** — `backdrop-filter: blur()` + semi-transparent backgrounds on cards/nav
- **Anti-gravity animation classes** — falling, rotating, bouncing keyframes applied via JS
- **Floating particles** — animated pseudo-elements / small circles on the landing page
- **Product cards** — hover lift/scale effects, image zoom, button glow
- **Responsive breakpoints** — mobile-first layout, hamburger menu at small screens
- **Smooth scroll** — `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- **Typography** — Google Font "Outfit" for bold, modern headings

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///c:/Users/ankit/Desktop/ai/script.js)
All interactivity in vanilla JavaScript:
- **Anti-gravity engine** — after 3s timeout OR "Enter Shop" button click:
  1. Select all `.gravity-item` elements on the landing page
  2. Apply randomized `translateY`, `rotate`, and `opacity` transitions to simulate falling
  3. Add bounce via CSS animation
  4. After animation (~2s), fade out landing, fade in main shop layout
- **Floating particles** — create and animate small DOM elements on the landing page
- **Cart counter** — increment badge number on each "Add to Cart" click, with a small pulse animation
- **Scroll animations** — IntersectionObserver to fade-in sections as they enter viewport
- **Sticky navbar shadow** — add shadow class on scroll
- **Mobile menu toggle** — hamburger icon opens/closes nav links
- **Reset button** — resets state to show landing page and replay gravity animation
- **Audio** — play a subtle "whoosh" sound when gravity triggers (using Web Audio API to generate a short synthetic sound, no external file needed)

### Product Images
Generate 6 product images using the `generate_image` tool to populate the product cards with realistic fashion items (t-shirts, jackets, sneakers, etc.) matching the brand's Gen-Z streetwear aesthetic.

## Verification Plan

### Browser Testing
1. Open `index.html` in the browser via the browser tool
2. Verify the anti-gravity landing page loads with floating particles and centered branding
3. Wait 3 seconds (or click "Enter Shop") and verify gravity fall animation plays
4. Verify main shop layout appears after animation completes
5. Click "Add to Cart" buttons and verify cart counter increments
6. Scroll through all sections and verify scroll-reveal animations
7. Click "Reset" button and verify the anti-gravity animation replays
8. Resize viewport and verify responsive layout
